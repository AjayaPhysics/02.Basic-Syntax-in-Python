# Basic Syntax in Python

| **Concept**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            | **Example**                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Case Sensitivity**        | Python is case-sensitive, meaning `variable` and `Variable` are treated as two different identifiers.                                                                      | `name = "Alice"` vs `Name = "Bob"`  |
| **Indentation**             | Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Indentation is mandatory and replaces braces used in other languages.                                                       | ```python\nif True:\n    print("Hello")\n```                                |
| **Comments**                | Comments start with a `#` for single-line comments and triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line comments.                                                            | `# This is a comment`               |
| **Variables**               | Variables are used to store data and do not require explicit declaration.                                                                                                  | `x = 10`                            |
| **Keywords**                | Reserved words in Python that cannot be used as variable names, like `if`, `else`, `while`.                                                                                 | `if x > 5:`                         |
| **Print Statement**         | Used to display output to the console.                                                                                                                                    | `print("Hello, World!")`            |
| **Input Statement**         | Used to take user input from the console.                                                                                                                                | `name = input("Enter your name: ")` |
| **Comments Style**          | Single-line comments use `#`. Multi-line comments are surrounded by triple quotes.                                                                                       | ```python\n# Single-line comment\n"""\nMulti-line comment\n"""\n```                            |
| **Dynamic Typing**          | Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.                                                                                             | `x = 5` (int), `x = "Hi"` (str)    |
| **Semicolons**              | Python does not require semicolons to terminate statements, though they can be used optionally.                                                                             | `print("Hello")`                    |
| **Whitespace**              | Excess whitespace between statements is ignored, but indentation within code blocks must be consistent.                                                                     | `y = 5` (valid)                     |
| **Quotation Marks**         | Strings can be defined using single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.                                                                                                          | `'Python'` or `"Python"`           |
| **Escape Characters**       | Special characters in strings, such as newlines (`\n`) or tabs (`\t`), are represented using escape sequences.                                                            | `"Hello\nWorld"`                   |
| **Identifiers**             | Names for variables, functions, and objects must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.                                           | `my_var = 10`                      |
| **Arithmetic Operators**    | Operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (exponentiation), `%` (modulo), and `//` (floor division) are supported.                                                           | `x = 5 + 3`                        |
| **Boolean Values**          | Python supports `True` and `False` as boolean values.                                                                                                                      | `x = True`                         |
| **Built-in Functions**      | Functions like `len()`, `type()`, `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` are readily available.                                                                                   | `print(len("Hello"))`              |
